# 🪳 Kataboshti

_You are a cockroach. Not just any cockroach — one that spins, gathers filth, and forces its way through with sheer grime-powered momentum._

**Kataboshti** is a third-person game where you play as a spinning roach that collects dirt to build a grotesque ball of debris. As you spin, your body merges with the filth around you, gaining size, weight, and… destructive power.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` – Move around  
- `Mouse` – Control the camera  
- `Spacebar` – Spin in place to gather filth  
- Press `Spacebar` again – Instantly dash forward and smash through obstacles

> Tip: The more you spin, the dirtier (and stronger) you get.

## 🧪 About the Game

Explore grotesque, organic environments across **three increasingly bizarre stages**.  
There are no lives. No Game Over.  
Just you, the dirt, and a strange journey ahead.

> _The more you spin, the weirder it gets._

Kataboshti is a physics-based game filled with strange challenges that reward creativity, persistence, and your tolerance for grime.
